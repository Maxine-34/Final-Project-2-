        <h1 class="bg-header">Brief Background</h2>
            <p class="p1">SDG 15, Life on Land, aims to reverse the damage that humans have caused
to the planet, particularly to terrestrial life. It saves and restores ecosystems
and the life in them, promoting sustainability and preservation to save both
ourselves and other species. SDG 15 focuses on reversing the following
problems: desertification, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and other
related issues affecting terrestrial life.</p>

<p class="p1">My advocacy not only focuses on the SDG in general, but more specifically
on saving plant biodiversity by planting trees, especially in the Philippines.
Our planet is home to many beautiful flora, each contributing a role in our
ecosystems and even our daily lives. Unfortunately, many of them are
endangered, including in places like the Philippines. In the previous year, it
was reported that out of the 46,337 species studied, approximately 58% of
them are threatened flowering plants, with an estimated 1% being other
plants (Statista & Salas, 2025). Meanwhile, out of an estimated 50,000 plant species in the Philippines(UNDP, 2023), 984 species of
flora are threatened as of 2024 (Department of Environment and Natural
Resources, 2024). Many of these species are endemic to the country, and as
Filipinos, we must protect them by facing problems such as habitat loss,
which can be the leading cause of endangerment (Population Education,
2021).</p>

<p class="p1">Habitat loss and deforestation are huge causes of endangerment. Forests
provide a home to approximately 80% of species (UNDP, n.d.). The
biodiversity loss of flora can cause a significant negative effect on our
ecosystems, which may even affect our lives. Thus, we must do what we can
to preserve not only the beauty of these species, but the stability and
significance of our environment.</p>

    <p class="p2">The Philippines faces many threats to its flora, one of them being 
        endangerment and related issues such as deforestation and habitat loss. 
        Thus, many solutions have been made by the government and multiple 
        organizations with their own advocacies.</p>
    <p class="p3">Many projects and organizations have been created to deal with the 
        aforementioned problems. One example is the “Protect Wildlife Project” 
        made in 2016, which focuses on addressing the dangers caused to wildlife 
        while tackling issues related to biodiversity loss, such as deforestation and 
        habitat loss, through many ways, such as raising awareness and changing 
        minds, and the enforcement of laws (Conservation International, n.d.).  
        Another recent significant situation is the Climate Change Commission (CCC) 
        showing the importance of biodiversity in our country’s ecosystems. They 
        suggested saving these habitats from illegal activity and protecting them 
        through close monitoring (Climate Change Commission, 2024).</p>
    <p class="p3">These programs and discussions show that as united Filipinos, we can 
        address problems concerning our home, especially the biodiversity and 
        ecosystems of our country. </p>

        <p>As a student, I am taught to care 
            about the environment and the amazing things it 
            holds. Seeing such beautiful and unique species be 
            threatened or be on the verge of extinction is a 
            saddening sight. Thus, I have decided to come up with
            this advocacy to save both us and the flora biodiversity. 
            It not only helps recover what was lost but also spreads 
            awareness to other people. Many students like me may also 
            be interested or would like to speak up about such problems 
            affecting our environments.</p>

<div class="sides2">
    <div class="border"></div>
    <p class="p4">Ignorance is deciding not to do anything about our threatened 
        flora. Being silent prevents awareness about this problem, 
        leading it to further worsen. We should not let the extinction 
        and endangerment of our plants stay hidden. Thus, we must spread 
        awareness and show the true importance of our plant diversity. 
        Saving our flora not only preserves our planet’s natural 
        environments, but also helps our daily lives and future in some 
        way as they are important in various resources and places 
        (we must not exploit the resources it provides though).</p>
