        <p class="p4">Then, I realized that lands like this, once full of nature 
            and biodiversity, can be taken down by human activities or 
            issues that may have stemmed from them. I realized that all 
            of these unique flora, each with its own beauty and purpose, 
            may not last long enough for other generations to see as well. 
            Not only that, but the loss of these plants can greatly affect 
            our planet and ecosystems in the long run. Thus, I conducted further 
            research and found more people, even students like me, who would want 
            to participate in solving this problem. We would plan what activities 
            to do and where to hold them. We all collectively agreed that our 
            planet's biodiversity needs to be saved. We may not be able to do it 
            through big or global solutions, but we can start small by focusing on 
            plant biodiversity, which has affected our everyday lives for a long time now.</p>

        <h1>How It Came To Be</h1>
        <p class="p4">As a child and student, I got curious about the world 
            around me and how everything works. I've always wanted 
            to help the world in some way, but didn't know how to 
            start doing so. It started on an adventure or vacation 
            with my family, which had a lot of plants and trees in 
            the scenery. The atmosphere was beautiful and gave a 
            sense of peace. </p>

            <p>I’m Maxine Kim Aquino, a Philippine Science High School- 
        Southern Mindanao Campus grade 9 student who wants to help 
        not only for the benefit of ourselves but for the benefit 
        of our planet’s condition. I have observed that many problems 
        affecting our lives involve plant biodiversity loss, including 
        pollution (land, water, air), lack of resources, and damage to 
        our ecosystems. Not only this, seeing so many species go extinct 
        is very heartbreaking for me. Thus, I chose to advocate native 
        tree planting to bring back at least a small portion of the plants 
        that we have lost to human activities.</p>
